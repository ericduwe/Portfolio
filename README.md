# **Portfolio Assignment - Homework 2**

### Project Description:

The deployed webpage is a starter template for a personal web development project portfolio. The page contains three sections:

1. About Me -- containing a profile photo and placeholder text for a personal bio

2. My Work -- containing placeholder images and placeholder links to house links/screenshots of future projects. The first project has a larger photo and link size than the second and third.

3. Contact -- containing placeholder email, LinkedIn, and phone number

   --*Note that there is a "CV" link in the nav bar. This is currently empty, but will house a resume/CV in the future.*



### Nav Bar:

The Nav bar contains links to each section of the page. Using smooth-scrolling, each link scrolls directly to its corresponding section. On smaller or mobile screens (max-width 768px), the nav bar is reordered from a horizontal list to a vertical one to avoid excessive horizontal scrolling.



### About Me:

The About Me section contains placeholder text (using "Lorem ipsum..") and a profile photo. As the screen size shrinks, the image resizes but maintains a minimum width and height after a certain point so that it isn't too small on mobile or tablet screens. The paragraph also has a minimum width for readability.



### My Work:

This section contains placeholder links to future applications in my portfolio. The first application's image is larger in size than the others. Note that the links all currently lead to Google as a placeholder URL.



### Contact:

The contact section contains methods of contacting me via phone, email or LinkedIn.
